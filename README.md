# Python Remote Access Tool
A novel, lightweight remote access tool written in Python.

# Overview

The Python Remote Access Tool (PyRAT) is capable of launching a server on an arbitrary IP address and port.  All commands sent to the client as well as responses from the client are recorded in a SQLite database called "pyrat.db" in the local directory of the server application.  A client application is utilized on a remote host to accept commands from the server and reply with responses.

# Complete Documentation

Please read the PDF for full documentation.  This is not a tool that is designed to replace Empire or Metasploit (it is designed to be lightweight), but since it's not well-known there won't be a signture detected by AV or IDS, etc.
